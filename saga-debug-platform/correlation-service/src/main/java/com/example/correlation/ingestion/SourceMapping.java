/**
 * How to read one external system's events into this platform's envelope.
 *
 * <p>Without this the platform can only ingest events that already use its own field
 * names — {@code sagaId}, {@code eventId}, {@code eventType}, {@code timestamp}. No
 * existing system emits those, so attaching the platform to one meant changing that
 * system's producers. A mapping states where each field lives in <em>their</em> payload
 * instead, so an unmodified system can be observed.
 *
 * <h2>What a declared path may say</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code key} — the transport's record key</li>
 *   <li>{@code header:NAME} — a transport header</li>
 *   <li>{@code source} — the topic, queue or source name the observation arrived on</li>
 *   <li>anything else — a dotted path into the payload, which is the default</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Any field may declare several of those instead of one, and the first that resolves
 * is used. Systems do not keep a field in the same place across every event they publish
 * — a v1 and a v2 of the same event, an id at the top level in one service and nested in
 * another — and the alternative was one mapping file per shape, or asking the source to
 * normalise what it emits.

     *
     * <h2>Why a mapping and a system are not the same thing</h2>
     * A mapping is a way of reading one shape of event; a system is an id space. One
     * system frequently needs several mappings, and not for want of trying to write one:
     * the saga in {@code semotpan/saga-orchestration} publishes on four topics whose
     * payloads all carry a field called {@code status}, and {@code CANCELLED} means "the
     * room booking was released" on one topic and "the payment was reversed" on another.
     * No single mapping can translate one field name two ways, and inventing a shared
     * vocabulary would be this platform asking the observed system to make sense on its
     * terms.
     *
     * <p>The namespace half of {@link com.example.correlation.domain.ExecutionKey} used to be taken from {@code name},
     * so those four mappings were four id spaces and one saga id was filed as up to four
     * half-finished executions — each looking stuck, and the payment fragment raising an
     * ORPHAN_EVENT because its first event starts no known workflow. Declaring
     * {@code system:} on each mapping is how several files say they are reading one
     * system, and it is a statement in a mapping file rather than something the platform
     * infers from two identifiers matching.
     *
     * <p>This does not weaken the protection {@code ExecutionKey} exists for. Two systems
     * that merely share an identifier still have different {@code system} values and so
     * still cannot reach each other; folding them together requires someone to write the
     * same name in both files, which is the same deliberate act as declaring
     * {@link #aliasSource}.
